# Ragithub is now open!

I have been working on ragit for more than a year now. Ragit is a RAG tool that allows you to easily create and share knowledge-bases. The "create" aspect is almost complete, enabling you to create and manage knowledge-bases in a git-like manner. However, the "share" part was incomplete. `clone`, `push` and `pull` commands have been available for long time, but there was no server to push to. There was a very simple server that you can clone sample knowledge-bases from, but you couldn't push anything to it and there was no user interface at all!

I have long dreamed of ragithub. Initially, I wanted a github-like interface. Anyone could create an account and create public or private knowledge-bases. Users could push their knowledge-bases and search through others. However, I soon realized that this was an overly ambitious goal for a hobby project. Managing user accounts would involve a multitude of tasks. Also, my EC2 instance has only 80 GiB of storage, and that's not big enough for github-like service.

So, I changed the direction. Ragithub is now the main website and blog for ragit, where you can also find knowledge-bases. Everything related to ragit will be uploaded to this website. I'll post updates and news here, CI results will be available here, and I'll aim to upload as many knowledge-bases as possible.
